# Introduction to Eloquent (The ORM from Laravel!)

As you may or may not already know, you can use Eloquent from any composer-enabled project!

This repository demonstrates the simplest configuration required to start using it.
 
Advantages offered by Eloquent are usually apparent right away, but you will find many of its 
conventions improve the way you author code over time.
 
## Notable Concepts

 - OOP: Namespacing and visibility modifiers
 - Conventions with class and variable names 
 - `Illuminate\Support\Arr` and `helpers.php`
 - Bulk assignment vs. individual assignment
 - `$visible`, `$hidden`, `$fillable`, `$guarded`
 - Query syntax
 - Relations
 - Eager loading
 

# Studying & Usage

It is perfectly normal for it to take a week or two to master the conventions of this ORM.  
Be sure to go through the [documentation for Eloquent](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/eloquent) and 
use it as a reference as you're getting started.
